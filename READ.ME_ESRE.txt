Methodology
---------------------------------------------------
*Data collection: Data was collected directly from the monitoring reports recieved for each site. Any data presented in these reports were compiled regardless of type of data. Both categorical and quantitative data were collected as well as pre-restoration (baseline) data and reference data if present. Data was taken from text, figures, and tables. For each data point recorded, we collected all of the following (if present): (1) Site name, (2) Sub site, (3) Habitat Type, (4) Habitat Type Area (acres), (5) Year post-completion, (6) Year, (7) Date Details, (8) Metrics, (9) Values, (10) Units, (11) Metric Groups, (12) Metric Type, (13) Collection Method, (14) Data Collection Frequency, (15) Restoration Goal Met? (Y/N), (16) Metric Significance, (17) Analyzed by who?, and (18) Notes. Each sites was compiled individually and compiled into a master data sheet once all the reports for the site were completed. 

*Indicator classification: The monitoring reports we analyzed had a mix of raw data, processed data, and conflicting monitoring indicators. We followed a similar methodology as Faber-Langendoen et al. (2006) to sort the information from the reports into “measurements,” “metrics,” and “indicators.” We define measurements to be any value that was collected directly from the field, metrics to be the values derived from measurements, and indicators to be representative of closely related metrics. In our data collection we compiled all three types depending on what the monitoring reports contained. We came up with a standardized list of 13 indicator categories that were commonly used throughout the monitoring reports to consolidate variations in naming or common function: (1) Water Quality, (2) Soil, (3) Topography, (4) Hydrology, (5) Vegetation Cover, (6) Vegetation Species Diversity, (7) Vegetative Growth and Health, (8) Non-native Species, (9) Fish, (10) Birds, (11) Endangered Species, (12) Invertebrates, (13) Other Fauna. We counted the frequency for each category by counting how many indicators were used within each one. However, not all measurements or metrics had explicitly stated indicators, so as long as an indicator was implied we would count it (e.g. if a list of species was given, we counted that as a diversity indicator even if no calculated value was given). There were also indicators that could fit multiple categories but were placed in the category that had greater importance placed on it (e.g. non-native vegetation cover would be placed in the “exotic species” category over the “vegetation cover” category). If a report had multiple indicators that measured similar variables but each indicator had a unique methodology, then we counted them separately in our frequency table, to account for the concerted effort necessary to collect that data.  The different methodology could also result in measurements that could be interpreted differently (e.g. fish abundance measurements in South San Diego Bay were taken with three different kinds of traps which all gave varying results, so each type of trap was counted separately). If one methodology was used for a monitoring activity, but multiple results were given that had unique importance then each one of importance was counted (e.g. for one bird survey both “bird abundance” and “bird diversity” would be counted under the bird category). If an indicator was used at multiple locations within a site, it would only be counted separately if the habitat type changed between locations. Sampling different habitats could capture unique results. Any historical data (e.g. precipitation or temperature), data that represented restoration actions (e.g. number of plants planted), or reference site data were not included in the frequency table. Overall, the methods do determine what counted as an indicator and what didn’t were complicated and relatively subjective. To help explain our process in determining what would count as well as help classify future monitoring activities we created a flowchart to help classify whether a specific measurement or data point from the reports qualified as an indicator 

*LRR analysis: The first major step in the LRR analysis was to tidy the data to reduce each site to the variables that were quantifiable and could be compared from the first year of monitoring to the last year of monitoring. Once each site had been filtered for the pertinent data, the individual sites were recombined to create one table with new columns that represented the degraded state (first year), restored state (most recent year), and the reference site (if available). Log response ratios were calculated to compare degraded-restored with the expected outcome to be positive (expected negative values for nonnative species were multiplied by negative 1) and to calculate restored-restored (expected values of 0 to represent no change from reference). These LRR values were avegerage and calculated for their standard deviation for each indicator group for each site to get mean LRR for each indicator group within each one. Theses averaged LRR values for each site's indicator groups were then graphed onto an axis of negative to positive values grouped by indicator category.

*Cluster analysis: We selected only three columns for the analysis from the "Monitoring_Master_Data.csv" - Site Name, Metrics and Metric Type. We performed cluster analysis to find the unique value (number of counts) of each metric type for each site. We visualized the data using heatmap. We performed cluster analysis on "Indicator_data.csv" to analyze the commonalities between the indicators at all the 8 sites. 

*Correspondance analysis: We performed Corresponding Analysis (CA) on two datasets: (1) "Monitoring_Master_Data.csv" and (2) "Indicator_data.csv". We aggregated the data of all the 8 remaining sites and selected only three columns for the analysis: 'Site Name', 'Metrics" and 'Metric Type'. We found the most commonly used metric types were 'Biological', 'Physical' and 'Chemical' and they were correlated and were used to define the success of the restoration projects.

*Map of Project Site Locations: The restoration monitoring reports were used to find the location of each site.  A red circle was placed on each site marking the location.

*Map of Metrics Used at Project Sites: The database of metrics used was used to create multipoint shapefiles for each metric.  A point for each metric was placed at each project site so that sites show all metrics used at that site.

*Map of Number of Metrics Used at Project Sites: The database of metrics used was used to create an attribute table listing each site and the number of metrics used at those sites. The attribute table was used to create a multipoint shapefile of metrics used at site.  Points were placed on each site and a gradient color scale was used to show the range of the number of metrics used at each site.
